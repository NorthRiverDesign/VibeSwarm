#
# Option 1: Setup Wizard (No Configuration Required)
# - If these variables are NOT set, the app will redirect to a setup wizard
# - You can create your admin account through the web interface
# - This is the easiest option for first-time users
#
# Option 2: Environment Variables (Recommended for Automated Deployments)
# - Set both DEFAULT_ADMIN_USER and DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASS below
# - The admin user will be created automatically on startup
# - This is ideal for CI/CD and scripted deployments
#
# Password Requirements:
# - Minimum 8 characters
# - At least one uppercase letter
# - At least one lowercase letter
# - At least one digit
# ====================================================

# Uncomment and configure for automated admin creation:
# DEFAULT_ADMIN_USER=admin
# DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASS=YourSecurePassword123!
